## Enhancing Development through Automation

When contemplating game development with less effort, procedural generation,[^1] which enables the programming of pixel art, sound effects, background music, and levels, is a potent tool. Although the quality may not match manually crafted assets, by iterating the generation process until satisfactory outcomes are achieved, one can acquire essential game assets with minimal effort. Moreover, by employing random level generation algorithms, players can enjoy a unique gameplay experience each time, thereby enhancing the game's replay value.

Here, let's explore methods of automating the generation of elements such as pixel art for characters, background music, sound effects, and levels in puzzle games.
